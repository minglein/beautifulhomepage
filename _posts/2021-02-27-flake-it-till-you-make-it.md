Heating tumors up to a temperature of about 43Â°C has shown to increase the sensitivity to radio- and chemotherapy, and thus improved treatment outcome in various cancer types including rectal and cervical cancer as well as sarcomas.
Hyperthermia has thus been established as a standard clinical treatment modality in conjunction with radio- and chemotherapy around the world.
MR temperature monitoring of deep mild RF hyperthermia has found its way into many clinics but is still confounded by phase change originating other than from temperature change, including B0 drift and susceptibility change. The latter introduces artefacts propagating with a dipolar shape and thus affects image regions far from its source. Using background field removal techniques known from QSM has shown to correct for both susceptibility change-induced phase changes and B0 drift at once. We have found that using a novel total field inversion approach further improves the performance of artefact correction.
