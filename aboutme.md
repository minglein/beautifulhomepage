My name is Mingming Wu. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Klinikum rechts der Isar, at the Technical University of Munich. In parallel, I am in my 4th year of medical training.

Bridging the gap between technical capabilities and clinical needs is my dream. Patient care will be my reward. 

### My journey


I studied Electrical Engineering in Karlsruhe including an 18 months stay at Phelma Grenoble INP, where I first saw two resonance peaks on an old oscilloscope - my first NMR experiment. I was hooked and a series of lucky circumstances followed that allowed me to flow along:
- During my Master Thesis at ETH I was learning a lot about Zero Echo Time imaging.  
- I continued a PhD program at the TUM on MR thermometry for monitoring mild RF hyperthermia treatments.
- In the [BMRR research group](y
https://bmrrgroup.de/) my research focusses on imaging properties of brown fat.
